  <p class="one"> The Reader Project began as a simple need for every child to have access to a book. In Bhutan, the only libararies present are located in the capital of the country, Thimphu. The rest of the dzongkhags do not have a library. Schools in remotest part of Bhutan have not enough books for the students. This has led to a vast lack in skills and interest especially towards literary scenario in Bhutan. It has inevitably hampered with creativity as well as problem-solving skills in children. </p>
